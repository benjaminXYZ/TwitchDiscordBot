# TwitchDiscordBot
This is a Twitch & Discord bot to add the ability of linking the Twitch chat to Discord and vice versa.
Why does it exist? I wanted to create this feature for a stream but couldn't find an existing repository, that's why I created it.
It is really simple and doesn't require much code.
If you are interested in adding this to your Twitch Stream, go on!

!!! I do not vouch for any issues, bugs and misuses. Use on your own risk. !!!

## How to use?
Paste your Twitch & Discord tokens into the config.json, specify your Twitch username and the channel.
Edit the `discord_channel` to the Id of the Discord Channel you want to use.
Start the application.

### How does it work?
Retrieves messages from both chats and sends it to the other chat.
The bot makes use of [discord.js](https://discord.js.org/) & [tmi.js](https://tmijs.com/)
